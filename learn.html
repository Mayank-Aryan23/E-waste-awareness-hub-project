      <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
      <p>
        E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices and components like smartphones, laptops, televisions, and other electronic products. 
        Due to rapid technological advancements and short product lifecycles, e-waste has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world. 
        E-waste also includes discarded household appliances such as refrigerators, air conditioners, and microwaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The improper disposal of e-waste, such as throwing electronics in the trash or leaving them to deteriorate in landfills, causes harmful substances to be released into the environment. E-waste contains valuable metals like gold, silver, and copper, which can be recovered and reused, but it also includes toxic chemicals that pose significant environmental risks.

    <!-- Environmental Impact -->
<article class="section">
  <h2>Environmental Impact of E-Waste</h2>
  <p>
    The environmental effects of e-waste are far-reaching. E-waste contains harmful substances such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lead:</strong> Used in the production of electronic components, lead is toxic to both humans and wildlife, causing neurological damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> Found in certain parts of electronic devices, mercury can damage the nervous system and contaminate water sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Cadmium:</strong> A carcinogen that affects kidneys and bones, often present in batteries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When electronics are improperly disposed of, these substances can leach into the soil and groundwater, polluting ecosystems. E-waste that ends up in landfills or is incinerated also contributes to air pollution, as toxic fumes are released into the atmosphere.

    <!-- Health Effects of E-Waste -->
    <article class="section">
      <h2>Health Effects of E-Waste</h2>
      <p>
        E-waste not only harms the environment but also poses serious health risks to humans. The toxic substances in e-waste can affect individuals directly and indirectly, particularly those involved in informal recycling processes in developing countries.
      </p>
      <h3>Impact on Humans:</h3>
      <p>
        Workers involved in the dismantling and recycling of e-waste without protective gear are exposed to hazardous materials like lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. These materials can cause severe health issues, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neurological Damage:</strong> Lead exposure can lead to brain damage, especially in children, affecting their cognitive development and behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancer:</strong> Cadmium and certain chemicals in e-waste are known carcinogens, increasing the risk of lung, liver, and kidney cancer.</li>
        <li><strong>Respiratory Problems:</strong> Toxic fumes from burning e-waste, such as plastic and heavy metals, can lead to chronic respiratory problems, including asthma and bronchitis.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin Diseases:</strong> Direct contact with toxic substances, such as mercury, can cause skin rashes, burns, and other dermatological conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact on Nature:</h3>
      <p>
        The contamination of soil and water with toxic e-waste chemicals has a far-reaching impact on ecosystems. Animals, particularly aquatic species, are vulnerable to the pollution of water bodies, where toxic chemicals from e-waste seep in. This not only harms biodiversity but can also enter the food chain, ultimately affecting human health.

    <!-- How to Recycle -->
    <article class="section">
      <h2>How to Recycle Electronics Properly</h2>
      <p>
        Recycling e-waste responsibly is essential for reducing its environmental impact. Hereâ€™s how you can properly dispose of old electronics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a certified e-waste recycling center near you.</li>
        <li>Ensure devices are wiped clean of personal data before disposal. You can perform a factory reset or use software tools to securely delete information.</li>
        <li>Recycle parts like batteries, cables, and screens separately. Batteries, for example, contain hazardous materials and need special handling.</li>
        <li>Check with your local government for e-waste collection events or designated drop-off locations.</li>
      </ul>

    <article class="section">
      <h2>Tips for Reducing E-Waste</h2>
      <p>Here are some practical steps you can take to reduce your e-waste footprint:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extend the life of your electronics by repairing them instead of discarding them. Many devices can be fixed with simple repairs or upgrades.</li>
        <li>Donate old electronics to charities, schools, or other organizations where they can be reused.</li>
        <li>Buy refurbished or second-hand electronics instead of new ones. This reduces the demand for the production of new devices, which generates more waste.</li>
        <li>Dispose of e-waste through certified recycling facilities. Make sure they follow environmentally friendly disposal practices.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- The Future of E-Waste Management -->
    <article class="section">
      <h2>The Future of E-Waste Management</h2>
      <p>
        As technology continues to advance, the amount of e-waste produced will only increase. However, various strategies and technologies are being developed to manage this growing issue:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Circular Economy:</strong> A shift toward a circular economy means reducing waste by reusing, repairing, and recycling electronics, which can help minimize e-waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Recycling Technologies:</strong> New methods of recycling are being developed that allow for better recovery of valuable materials, such as rare earth metals, from electronic waste.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</strong> Some countries are introducing policies that require electronics manufacturers to take responsibility for their products after they are discarded, encouraging better recycling and waste management practices.</li>
      </ul>
